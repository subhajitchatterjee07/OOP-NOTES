Return to [[CONSTRUCTORS AND DESTRUCTORS]]

A constructor that accepts no parameters is called as a default constructor.

Example:
The default constructor of **A is A : : A( ) **

- If no such constructor is defined, then the compiler supplies a default.
- The statement such as A a; invokes the default constructor of the compiler to create the object a.
