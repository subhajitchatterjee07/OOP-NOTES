A crucial feature of OOP is 'polymorphism' . It means 'one name multiple forms'.
Example of this is function and operator overloading.

If there are member functions having the same prototypes in different levels of inheritance, we can address this situation using scope(class) resolution operator.  This is known as ***STATIC BINDING***. That is, the compiler is able to select an appropriate function for a particular function for a particular call at compile time itself.
